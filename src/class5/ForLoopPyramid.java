Write a method that prints out a pyramid of *'s.
Use a class constant to define the size of the pyramid.

In order to add the correct leading spaces, you'll have
to write a nested for loop, one for the spaces and one
for the stars.

Later on, we'll learn how to accept user input for the size
of the pyramid.  For now, just pass it in to the method.
