/*
In this example, we'll work on structuring our program using methods.

We'll be using the song "Hey Jude" by the Beatles (the greatest band
of all time) to practice.

To begin, breakup the song into discrete parts and write your method
headers below the main method.

Copy and paste the corresponding print statements into the methods and
add a blank line to the end of each one.

In your main method, call each of the methods once, except for the outro,
which we'll call 19 times (for now, just copy and paste these, we'll look
at a much easier way to do this with for loops later in the course)
