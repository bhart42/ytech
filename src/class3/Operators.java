In this example, we'll cover how to use variables and operators
to calculate a bill for a meal at a restaurant.

Let's say that the bill for your meal is $20, the tax is 8.1%,
and you want to leave a tip of 15% for you're nice waiter.

Assign these values to variables and make the necessary calculations
to find your total bill.  Save this value in a variable and print it
to the console.
