In this program, you'll use what we learned about operators to write
a method that calculates the area of a circle.

Recall that the area of a circle is equal to pi * (radius ^ 2).
Find the area of a circle that has a radius of 12 inches.
Print your answer to the console with a label for the units.

Later, we'll learn how to generalize this method to calculate
the area of a circle with a radius of any size.
