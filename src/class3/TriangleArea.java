In this program, you'll use what we learned about operators to write
a method that calculates the area of a triangle.

Recall that the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2.
Find the area of a triangle that has a base of 6.25 feet and
a height of 3.5 feet.  Print your answer to the console with
the phrase "This triangle has an area of ____ feet".

Later, we'll learn how to generalize this method to calculate
the area of a triangle with a base and height of any size.
