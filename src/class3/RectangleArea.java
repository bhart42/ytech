In this program, you'll use what we learned about operators to write
a method that calculates the area of a rectangle.

Recall that the area of a rectangle is length * width.
Find the area of a rectangle that is 4 feet long and
3 feet wide.  Print your answer to the console with
a label for the units (square feet).

Later, we'll learn how to generalize this method to calculate
the area of a rectangle with a length and width of any size.
